# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dotenv Dependency Issue
**Problem**: The application was trying to import 'dotenv' module which was not found in the production build.

**Solution**: 
- Added dotenv as a production dependency via the package manager
- Modified environment variable handling in `server/storage.ts` to be more robust
- Removed the `import "dotenv/config"` statement and replaced with fallback logic for environment variables
- Added `ensureSupabase()` helper function to handle missing Supabase configuration gracefully

### 2. Build Process Issues
**Problem**: The build process was not including production dependencies needed at runtime.

**Solution**:
- Created a new build script at `scripts/build-production.js` that properly handles bundling
- Used `packages: 'external'` to avoid bundling complex dependencies that cause build failures
- Added explicit external marking for problematic packages (lightningcss, @babel/preset-typescript, etc.)
- Created `scripts/deploy-build.js` for complete deployment builds

### 3. Environment Variable Handling
**Problem**: Environment variables were not properly configured for production deployment.

**Solution**:
- Updated `server/storage.ts` to handle multiple environment variable naming patterns
- Added fallback logic: `process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL || process.env.SUPABASE_URL`
- Added null checks and error handling for missing Supabase configuration
- Created helper function to ensure Supabase client is available before use

## Files Modified

1. `server/storage.ts`:
   - Removed dotenv import
   - Added robust environment variable handling
   - Added `ensureSupabase()` helper function
   - Updated Supabase client initialization with null checks

2. `scripts/build-production.js`:
   - New build script for production deployment
   - Handles complex dependencies properly
   - Uses external packages approach

3. `scripts/deploy-build.js`:
   - Complete deployment build script
   - Builds both frontend and backend
   - Includes verification and deployment checklist

## Deployment Instructions

1. **For manual deployment**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/deploy-build.js
   npm run start
   ```

2. **For Replit deployment**:
   - The existing `.replit` configuration should work with these fixes
   - Ensure environment variables are configured in Replit Secrets
   - The build command in `.replit` will use the standard npm build process

## Environment Variables Required

The following environment variables need to be configured in production:

- `SUPABASE_URL` or `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` or `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (optional)

## Testing

The production build can be tested locally with:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

The server should start on port 5000 without errors.
