# Deployment Fixes - Status Report

## âœ… Issues Resolved

All deployment issues mentioned in the error report have been successfully fixed:

### 1. âœ… Supabase Configuration Fixed
**Original Issue**: "Supabase URL environment variable is not configured or accessible at runtime"

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `server/storage.ts` to handle multiple environment variable naming patterns
- Added fallback logic: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL || SUPABASE_URL`
- Implemented robust error handling for missing configuration
- Added `ensureSupabase()` helper function for graceful degradation

**Verification**: âœ… API calls to `/api/companies/startups` return data successfully

### 2. âœ… Application Startup Fixed
**Original Issue**: "Application fails to start due to missing required Supabase configuration"

**Solution Applied**:
- Removed problematic `import "dotenv/config"` statement
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Implemented graceful startup with clear error messages

**Verification**: âœ… Server starts successfully on port 5000

### 3. âœ… Port Binding Fixed
**Original Issue**: "Server cannot bind to port 5000 causing connection refused errors"

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `server/index.ts` to support both development and production port configuration
- Added support for `PORT` environment variable for Cloud Run deployment
- Maintained backward compatibility with port 5000 for Replit environment

**Verification**: âœ… Server binds correctly and responds to HTTP requests

### 4. âœ… Build Process Optimized
**Original Issue**: "Remove dotenv import that's causing build issues in production"

**Solution Applied**:
- Removed dotenv dependency from server code
- Created production-ready build script (`scripts/production-deploy.js`)
- Implemented tsx-based production deployment for faster builds
- Added TypeScript configuration for production (`tsconfig.production.json`)

**Verification**: âœ… Application compiles and runs without dotenv errors

## ðŸ“‹ Environment Variables Configuration

The application now supports multiple environment variable patterns:

### Required for Production:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key

### Optional:
- `PORT` - Server port (defaults to 5000 for Replit, uses Cloud Run PORT in production)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - For admin operations (optional)

### Current Status:
- âœ… `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Configured and working
- âœ… `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Configured and working
- âœ… Environment variable fallback logic implemented

## ðŸš€ Deployment Ready

The application is now ready for production deployment with:

1. **Robust Environment Handling**: Multiple fallback patterns for environment variables
2. **Cloud Run Support**: PORT environment variable handling for container deployment
3. **Production Build Process**: Optimized scripts for deployment
4. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of missing configurations
5. **Database Connectivity**: Verified Supabase connection and data retrieval

## ðŸ”§ Deployment Instructions

### For Replit Deployment:
1. Ensure environment variables are set in Replit Secrets
2. Use the existing workflow or run `npm run dev` for development
3. For production: run `node scripts/production-deploy.js` then `npm run start`

### For External Deployment (Cloud Run, etc.):
1. Set environment variables: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `PORT`
2. Run: `node scripts/production-deploy.js`
3. Start: `node dist/index.js`

## âœ… Verification Complete

All deployment issues have been resolved and the application is functioning correctly:
- Server starts without errors
- Database connectivity established
- API endpoints responding with data
- Environment variables properly handled
- Production build process optimized

**Status**: Ready for deployment ðŸš€
